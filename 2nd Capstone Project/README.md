2nd Capstone Project
Problem: 
Honey is an important food source. The consumption of honey and bee larvae likely provided significant amounts of energy, supplementing meat and plant food. In 2006, beekeepers globally were struck by honey bee colony collapse disorder (CCD).The best way to to kill CCD is the use of a family of pesticides called neonics; however, the excess neonics may kill bees over extented periods. Thus, predicting the honey production and track the correlational evidence between the usage of neonics and honeybee colonies are very useful.
In this project, my two objects are: firstly, predict the honey production; secondly, find out the correlational evidence between the usage of neonics and the numbers of honeybee colonies.
In this project we analyze the honey production, honey colony number changing and the applied neonics pesticide data.
Potential Clients
The beekeepers and the customers who consume the honey would be my clinet. My production prediction would give suggestions to beekeepers to obtain the highest value of sales;  and the prediction on how to use neonics to obtain the most honey colonies would benefit the beekeeps to keep the bee healthy and maximize the honey production; finally, All these factors will promise the enough honey providing in the market for consumers.
Data
I am using the honey bees colonies and neonicotinoids data, which comes from Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/kevinzmith/honey-with-neonic-pesticide#vHoneyNeonic_v03.csv

Approach:
1.	Apply data wrangling, exploratory data analysis on the scraped data set.
2.	Apply matplotlib to visualize the correlations.
3.	Apply deep learning models for this supervised classification problem.

Used Packages:
1.	Data Wrangling and Visualization: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
2.	Natural Language Processing: re, nltk, wordcloud
3.	Machine Learning and Deep Learning: sklearn, keras

Deliverables:
1.	Code
