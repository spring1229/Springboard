### Take home Challenge
#### This project is mainly working on analyzing activity trends over time, designing an A/B test, and predicting user retention.
#### The notebook has three parts. Part 1 has an analysis of activity as it varies with time. Part 2 describes a possible A/B test to encourage drivers to work between cities. Part 3 wrangles the data and builds predicitive models to identify which factors are most important for user retention and suggests future efforts to increase retention.
